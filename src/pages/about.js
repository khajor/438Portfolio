								I&apos;m a 5th year student at the University of Washington
								studying Human Centered Design &#38; Engineering Â and Drawing
								and Painting. I am interested in how humans interact with
								technology and work towards making them more accessible and
								sustainable. I am drawn to understanding the human experience as
								technologies continue to evolve and shape the world around us.
								<br></br> <br></br>
								My artistic practice allows me to explore these topics. Drawing
								a connection between traditional art and HCDE, provides me with
								new ideas and a unique perspective. I hope to find a career that
								allows me to practice art, graphic design and engineering.
